# Machine-Learning-Andrew-Ng-Programming-Exercises
Stanford University Machine Learning Course taught by Andrew Ng on Coursera

My own implementations of the course exercises in Python.
Boiler plate code rewritten, to gain more experience with Python data libraries.

File format in general aims to mimic that of the course exercises.
However, frequently this is not the case for convenience, and this is detailed in README files in each folder.

Actual submissions were not made; it did not appear a good use of time to reimplement the code for submission.
So, whilst I cannot guarantee an identical match to the answers, where possible answes matched those given in the original assignments.
Sanity checks through plotting or similar additionally show that even if not in 100% agreement with original answers, solutions are practically sufficient.
