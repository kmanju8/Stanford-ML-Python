Not the most elegant in comparison to the original ex1.m file, but hey.

All main implementation for ex1 handled in plotData.py. Could've made a ex1.py... but cba.

Ex2 will probably be on a different file, which will be recorded here as needed.
Optional extensions run on ex1multi as main file.

3.2.1 skipped, not that technical and main point of it kinda unneeded to test.
